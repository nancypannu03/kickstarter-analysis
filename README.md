# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise, a Playwright is willing to start a crowdfunding campaign for her play and expecting a budget of over $10,000 for this play. She is little worried about starting her first campaign, so we will be assisting Loiuse with various Data Analysis skills such as filter/format the raw data which will result in creating the easy visualization of the data. Thus, helping her to generate the ideas and factors for a successful campaign.


### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyse the previous data to help Louise with her fundraising campaign. In this project we will be using data analysis skills and excel functions to filter the Kickstarter data and create the pivot tables, charts and graphs for the better visualization of the data.
